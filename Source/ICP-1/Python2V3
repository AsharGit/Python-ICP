There are a few differences between Python 2 and Python 3, the major differences are:

1.  Library compatibility: Many Python 2 libraries are not compatible with Python 3 and as more developers are creating
    libraries for Python 3, Python 2 will lag behind Python 3.
2.  String storage: In Python 2 string were stored as ASCII while in Python 3 strings are stored as unicode by default.
3.  Rounding: In Python 2 division of integers that would produce a decimal result would get rounded down to the
    nearest int. In Python 3, the result is presented as a decimal value.
4.  Syntax: There are some changes to the syntax between Python 2 and Python 3, an example is the print statement which
    was changed to a function:
    Python 2: print "Hello"
    Python 3: print("Hello")
